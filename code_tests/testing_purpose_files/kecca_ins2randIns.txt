# SIMULATION FILE

## Control signals

In this file you can introduce all the information regarding the simulation.

First, introduce some information about the control signals for a correct simulation:

	N_RESET_CYCLES = `1` -- Number of reset clock cycles. By default always 1. Select the TOTAL number of cycles, including the first reset
	N_LOAD__CYCLES = `1` -- If the design is a serial implementation or just a pipeline (where there is no "done" signal), this tells the tool how many initial cycles to make the loading (and then the number of cycles at the end to capture complete output) or how many cycles should the pipeline run respectively. Even if you do not have a "load" signal but you still have a serial design that needs some 

	N_SHARES = `1`
	
Second, introduce number of random inputs to run in the experiment

	N_TRACES = `10` -- Select the number of random inputs to be randomly generated by the tool (if you do not specify your own inputs)

Finally, if you want to provide the inputs yourself, leave N_TRACES = 0 (the program stops reading the file in the case =0) and introduce the inputs below
